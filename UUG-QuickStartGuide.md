#Tips for running an Unity User Group (UUG)

As a Unity User Group organizer, you have the opportunity to share your knowledge, experience, and skills with the Unity community. Organizing a UUG is a great way to advance your career, network with other talented engineers, and learn new skills. It’s also a lot of fun! 

In the following quick start guide, we’ve gathered best practices from community organizers from Unity User Groups (UUG) around the world. Whether it’s your first UUG or your thousandth, we hope that you discover new ideas in this guide. And if you have a tip or trick that isn’t included, let us know on slack at http://UnitySlackers.com in #uug-organizers.

# Planning Your meetup

Unity Meetup.com Portal: http://www.meetup.com/pro/unity/

It’s time to plan your Unity User Group! But how do you get started? Here’s what you need to know. 

* Finding a venue 
* Finding a home for your Unity User Group (UUG) is the first step. Here are some possible meeting spaces:
* A nearby Unity office
* The office of a Unity partner
* The office of a Unity customer
* A co-working space
* A local company that is hiring engineers
* An agency that places engineers
* University/College facilities

### You can also:
* Research training facilities that donate space
* Check where other local user groups are meeting
* Inquire if one of your members can host at their office

### What does the ideal venue look like?
* Centrally located and easy to get to
* Close to public transportation and/or near parking
* Has A/V facilities available such as projector or TV
* Wifi access
* Seating for 20-30+ attendees

### Keep in mind
When you start, your group will likely fit in a conference room, board room or even a cafe. As you begin to meet regularly, your group will grow and you will likely need to find a larger venue. 

When you book your venue, make sure to ask about any special security requirements for venue access (i.e. does the host need a list of attendees in advance?), parking instructions, and wifi access. Be sure to include those details on your event RSVP page. 

Most companies will be delighted to host your group. You are bringing talented professionals into their office! Offer to make your hosts official sponsors of the group. Give them the opportunity to address the audience at the beginning of the event for a few moments to talk about their product/service. List them as a sponsor on your event page. Thank your host during the event. Make it valuable for your host so they keep inviting you back! 

## Choosing a date and time 
Before you schedule your event, make sure to double check the calendar for related meetups, as well as holidays. We recommend surveying your members for dates/times that work well and getting your group into a regular meeting cadence (meeting at the same time every month or quarter). 

## Finding a speaker 
Great content is the most important part of a great UUG. There are many ways that you can find speakers for your event:
* Ask your members from your user group. The best way to do this is in person during the previous month’s event, where you’ll often discover interesting Unity use cases.
* Visitors. Is there an interesting conference in town? You might want to look at the roster to see if there is a great speaker that would be appropriate for your event.
* Lightning talks. Short presentations are a great way to get the crowd engaged without asking someone to commit to building a lengthy presentation. It’s a great way to introduce your members to presenting.
* Study groups. Does your group have a lot of beginners? Consider working together on the next online course and helping each other through the coursework. Perhaps you can all become Unity Certified!
* Join forces. Consider partnering up with another group in your area to host joint events. Search on meetup.com for groups that have similar interests.
* Check out the presentation folder on Unity Slackers Github repo for presentations. Our speakers take pride in making great content available everyone that uses Unity.
* Ask Unity. They often know about customers and partners in your area that might be available to present. Feel free to contact Emma for suggestions on UnitySlackers.com in channel #ask-unity

## Speaking about Unity 
Are you trying to convince someone in your group to speak? Or trying to work up the courage yourself? Here are a few reasons to present on Unity:
* Personal Name Recognition: Get your name out there with Unity users
* Association with a great product gives you credibility
* Boost your speaking abilities and practice presenting
* Polish your knowledge of Unity - speaking forces you to deepen your knowledge
* Spread the word about a program that has changed and enhanced your career
* Showcase your company - speaking on specific use cases can be an easy way to promote your own organization
* Recruit candidates with Unity interest or skills

As you are getting your talk ready, it’s helpful to put yourself in the audience’s shoes. These are the things your members are probably looking to get out of their UUG experience: 

* Audience members want to learn from you and from your experience
* Attendees hope to meet other Unity users to network and exchange ideas
* Use cases and experience help people avoid similar errors
* Why is it important to share your experience with others?
* Every presentation given grows the collective knowledge base about Unity
* Participation in events helps strengthen the community around Unity

### What should you talk about? 
Teach something! Unity members have different levels of experience with Unity, but everyone wants to learn more. The best presentations come from experience. Talk about topics you are comfortable with --- as technical or as conceptual as they may be. 

Some great topics to include:
* My Unity Journey (how I got started with Unity)
* Latest patch changes and how this may improve or affect your projects
* My project and how I used Unity to create it
* etc

### Ten tips for having a great presentation:
* Rehearse! Rehearse! Rehearse! Practice running through your slides in your deck and consider how well your talk flows from one slide to the next. You may find that some slides are unnecessary or hard to explain without further details. It's very helpful to get an idea of the timing for your talk so you aren't trying to fit 30 minutes of slides into a 25 minute session (or vice-versa).
* Know your audience: If you're presenting at a UUG, you should ideally attend at least one prior event so you have an idea of typical attendees and the level of technical detail expected. The event organizer should also be able to give you some guidance on the level of Unity experience and what the audience might be particularly interested in.
* Know your venue: Ask about the room/venue where you will be presenting so you can match your slide deck to the environment. Consider the room size and available A/V options (projector, TV, sound, ...) and for projectors/TVs ask about the native resolution (i.e. 1280x720) and available connectors (HDMI, DisplayPort, VGA).
* Be concise: Avoid including full text such as sentences and paragraphs in your slides, and try to minimize the number of slides included. The audience is there to hear you share your experience, not to read your slides.
* Be visual: A clever picture, easy to read chart, be careful with gifs but they do help support points, or even simple bullet points can convey clear information. Visuals are often more effective than code examples, and can also be useful if you want to adapt the level of detail in your talk delivery based on the audience.
* Use big fonts: Some meeting rooms are large and text may be hard to see from the back of the room.
* Check for contrast: Depending on the brightness of the room and the A/V equipment, some color combinations may look great on a laptop screen but be difficult for the audience to read on a projector.
* Focus code samples: As a rule of thumb, keep code samples between 8-10 lines for simple readability. Highlight the important lines.
* Check your spelling and grammar: Attention to detail is important, particularly for technical audiences. Obvious spelling and grammar errors can be distracting and some audience members may feel compelled to point these out.
* Consider speaker notes: Many user group organizers make slides available online after the user group. Consider adding speaker notes with some extra context to explain slides for viewers who don't have the benefit of your accompanying talk.

### Tools for presenting
* Deckset - Markdown presentation software
* Google Slides - Web based presentation software

Note: Be sure to save a copy of your deck just incase the internet goes out.

# Being a great organizer

## Get into a cadence 
We’ve found that the most successful organizers get their user groups into a regular cadence. They meet on a consistent schedule, whether that’s monthly, quarterly, or some other schedule, and they typically meet at the same place or alternate between venues. The members get into a rhythm with the group and come to expect the UUG at a specific time and place. 

A UUG doesn’t have to meet monthly. One great meetup a quarter is often better than three ordinary meetups a quarter. And in many cases, UUGs that meet quarterly will build momentum and start meeting monthly. 

Publish your yearly calendar of events if you can. Even noting the next 1 or 2 meeting dates helps. 

## Make it a team effort 
Organizing a UUG takes some effort, so assembling some co-organizers can greatly increase your chance of success. Having co-organizers also means that you’ll have more ideas for speakers and content, and new channels for promotion. During UUG's, always ask your members if people are interested in volunteering or co-organizing. The more hands on deck, the better. 

You can also ask if members are part of other meetup groups that might like to partner with your UUG. 

## Over-communicate 
Coordinating with speakers, hosts, and sponsors requires follow up. A great organizer always sends detailed reminder emails. 

## Plan ahead 
When you are running your event, have the next meetup date scheduled so you can announce in advance and solicit speakers.
