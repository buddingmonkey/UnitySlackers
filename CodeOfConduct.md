# Unity Slackers Code of Conduct

Thanks for your interest in joining Unity Slackers! Before you join the conversation, please take a moment to read these guidelines. They exist to better ensure you and everyone else has the best experience possible.
By signing up for Unity Slackers, you agree to follow these guidelines to the best of your abilities. Anyone who violates these guidelines may be warned or banned appropriately.
Always be civil

* This is a shared community resource. It’s a place to share skills, knowledge and interests through ongoing conversation. Help us make this a great place for discussion by always working to improve the conversation in some way, however small.
* Think before you type. If you are not sure your message adds to the conversation, think about what you want to say and come back to it when you are ready.
* Exercise common sense. Do not post anything that a reasonable person would consider offensive, abusive, obscene, sexually explicit or hate speech.
* Be respectful of the law. Discussing illegal activities, copyright infringement, pirated intellectual property, explicit materials, malicious software, descriptions of or methods for stealing someone’s intellectual property is highly discouraged. Also avoid sharing anything digital that doesn’t belong to you without permission.

## Respect each other
* Criticize ideas, not people. Avoid things like name-calling, ad hominem attacks, responding to a message’s tone instead of its actual content and knee-jerk reactions. Instead, provide reasoned counter-arguments that improve the conversation.
* Lead by example. When dealing with people who are new to Unity Slackers or Unity in general, please consider taking the opportunity to teach and guide them instead of attacking or condemning them.
* Don’t be a jerk. Personal attacks, trolling, harassment, discrimination, threatening comments or any intentionally annoying behavior will not be tolerated.
“Google it” is not a useful answer. If you can’t help someone, defer to someone who can or say nothing at all.
* Keep private information private. Do not publish private information of any kind without explicit permission from the source.

## Respect the Slack
* Find an appropriate channel before starting a conversation or asking a question.
* Do not post spam or otherwise vandalize the Slack.
* Do not cross-post the same thing in multiple unrelated channels.
* Do not remove pinned items from any channel without permission from a moderator or administrator.
* Do not set the topic for any channel without permission from a moderator or administrator.
* Instead of writing something like “+1” or “Agreed”, consider using Reaction Emoji to express yourself.

Thanks all, thanks for reading the Unity Slackers Code of Conduct.
